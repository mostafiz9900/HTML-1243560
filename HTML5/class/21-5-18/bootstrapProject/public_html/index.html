It also calculates that if, on average, there is just half-a-child less per family in the future than it has assumed, there will be one billion fewer of us by 2050 than it expects – and four billion fewer by the end of the century (within the lifetimes of many children born today).  Billions less mouths to feed, land to use and greenhouse gases to be produced.
